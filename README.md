# TRI-TAC

Here is the official rules for Tri-Tac. The game aims to maximize the number of "3-in-a-row" combinations before the board is filled. The base version includes scoring objectives and mini challenges to keep the gameplay interesting.

### Objective
The goal of Tri-Tac is to score the highest number of points by creating as many three-in-a-row combinations as possible on a scalable grid before the board is filled.

### Equipment
- A square game board; the size can vary (e.g., 5x5, 6x6, etc.), depending on the players’ agreement.
- Two sets of markers, one for each player (e.g., X and O).

### Setup
- Players decide on the size of the board.
- Players choose their markers.
- Determine who goes first by coin flip or any other agreed-upon method.

### Gameplay
- Players take turns placing their marker on any unoccupied space on the board.
- Each completed "three-in-a-row" (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) earns points.
- Once a three-in-a-row is completed, those spaces remain as part of the board and can intersect with new lines formed by either player.
- The game continues until all squares on the board are filled.

### Scoring
- Each unique three-in-a-row scores 1 point.
- If a player creates two intersecting three-in-a-row lines in a single move, it scores 3 points.
- A three-in-a-row that extends to a four-in-a-row (or longer) does not count for additional points, maintaining the focus on creating as many distinct sets of three as possible.

### Winning the Game
- The player with the most points when the board is filled is the winner.
- If both players have the same score when the board is filled, the game is a draw.

### Mini Challenges (Optional)
To enhance gameplay, consider adding these optional rules:
- **Power Play**: Once per game, a player can remove one of the opponent’s previously placed markers and place their own in its spot. This can only be used once the player has at least 5 points.
- **Combo Strike**: If a player scores two consecutive three-in-a-rows in consecutive turns, they earn an extra point for a combo.
- **Time Challenge**: Implement a timer for each move (e.g., 30 seconds). If a player fails to move within the time limit, they lose their turn.

### Variations
For more complex gameplay, consider these variations:
- **Dynamic Board**: Allow the board to expand. Once the initial board is filled, players can vote to add one more row and column around the perimeter, continuing the game on a larger scale.
- **Special Squares**: Designate certain squares on the board that offer double points if a player forms a three-in-a-row involving these squares.
